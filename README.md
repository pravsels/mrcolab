# Welcome to MR Colab 

A 2-player social VR/AR game. 
In it, one player wears an AR headset (HoloLens 2) and is physically in an office room (Prof. Anthony Steed's room). 
Another player wears a VR headset (Quest 2) and is in a virtual representation of the same office room (built from a 3D scan). 


## Background 

The story is that 2 people were trespassing in my supervisor's office and he'd setup a booby trap to banish one person into the virtual realm to teach them a lesson. 
To escape, both the players have to co-operate and solve challenges. These challenges are setup such that without good communication and co-operation, they can't be done. 


More details: in the real room there was a rasbpberry Pi with access to google home. that can be used by the person in AR to control the size of the person in VR. the size control is necessary to see clues. 
once the clues are read by the person in VR, the person in AR can use the Pi home to ask questions for help. 
the last clue was written on a piece of paper in invisible ink that can only be seen if the person in VR properly controls a smart switch that turns on the UV light in the real room.
